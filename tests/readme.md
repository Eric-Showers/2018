# Testing hirethissnake
Testing your code is important in any development situation. We believe that hirethissnake is no different, so we've written some test cases here.

## Usage

Naturally, you'll need a copy of hirethissnake on your machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/phildenhoff/hirethissnake
```
`cd` into the new folder. To perform the tests, you'll have to execute the `test_suite` file in  `tests` package, as such:

```shell
python -m tests.test_suite -v
```
